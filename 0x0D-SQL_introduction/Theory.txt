    What is Database & SQL?
        What is data?
            Data can be facts related to any object in consideration like name,
            age, height, weight, picture, images. file, pdf...etc

        What is a database?
            A database is a sytematic collection of data. Since the data in a
            database is organized, it makes data management easy.

        What is a database management system (DBMS)?
            It is a collection of programs which enables its users to access
            database, manipulte data, & help in representation data. It also
            helps control access to the database by various users.

        Types of DBMS
            - Hierarchical: This type employs the parent-child relationship of
            storing data. Its structure is like a tree with nodes representing
            records and branches representing fields
            - Network DBMS: This type supports many to many relationships this
            usually results comples database structures
            - Relational DBMS: This type defines database relationships in form
            of tables also known as relations. Usually has predefined data
            types that they can support. This is the most popular DBMs type in
            the market.
            - Object oriented relation DBMS: This type supports storage of new
            data types, the data to be stored is in the form of objects.

        What is SQL?
            structured Query Language is actually the standard language for
            dealing with relational databases. It Allows us INSERT, SEARCH,
            UPDATE, AND DELETE DATABASE RECORDS.

            MySQL, ORACLE, MS SQL SERVER, SYBASE use SQL.

    Basics of MySQL
        Installing MySQL on Ubuntu

            sudo apt-get install mysql-server

        How to access the MySQL shell

            mysql -u root -p

            To keep in mind:
                - All MySQL commands end with semicolon; if the phrase does not
                end with a semicolon, the command will not execute

        How to create and delete a MySQL database
            MySQL organizes its information into databases; each one can hold
            tables with specific data.

            We can quickly check what databases are avaible by typing:

                SHOW DATABASES;

            Creating a database is very easy:

                CREATE DATABASE database_name;

            The phrase most often used to deleted objects is Drop:

                DROP DATABASE database_name;

        How to access a MySQL Database
            Once we have a new database, we can begin to fill it with
            information.

            The first step is to create a new table within the larger database.

            Open the database we want to use:

                USE database_name

            We can see an overview of the tables that the database contains

                SHOW tables;

        How to create a MySQL table
            Let's create a new MySQL table like:

                CREATE TABLE table_name(item_name data_type,...);

                Each item will be a column in our table.

            We can see our table organization with:

                DESCRIBE table_name;

        How to add information to a MySQL table
            We use the following format to insert information into each row:

                INSERT INTO `table_name` (items) VALUES(Values_of_each_item_separated_by_colon);

            We can take a look at our table with:

                SELECT * FROM table_name;

        How to update information in the table
            We use:

                UPDATE `table_name`
                SET
                `item_name` = `value`
                WHERE `table_name`.`item_with_a_relation` = `value_of_item_with_a_relation`

        How to add and delete a column
            We can easily add with this:

                ALTER TABLE table_name ADD item type_of_item;

            If we want to add to place the new column in a specific spot in the
            table, we use:

                ALTER TABLE table_name ADD item type_of_item AFTER item_name;

            We can delete a delete a column with:

                ALTER TABLE  table_name DROP item_name;

        How to delete a row
            We can use the following command:

                DELETE from [table_name] where [item_name]=[value_of_item];

        DDL and DML
            SQL statements are divided into two major categories:

                Data definition language (DDL):
                    DLL statements are used to build and modify the structure
                    of our tables and other objects in the database. When we
                    execute a DDL statement, it takes effect immediately

                Data manipulation language (DML):
                    DML statements are used to work with the data in tables

        Data types
            The data types that we will use most frequently are character
            strings, which might be called VARCHAR or CHAR for variable or
            fixed length strings; numeric types such as NUMBER or INTEGER,
            which will usually specify a precision; and DATE or related types.

            Data type syntax is variable from system to system. We must consult
            the documentation for our own software

        Basic Queries
            Retrieving data from one table
                In SQL, to retrieve data stored in our tables, we use the
                SELECT statement.

                Basic syntax:

                    SELECT {attribute}+
                        FROM {table_name}+
                        [WHERE {boolean predicate to pick rows}]
                        [ORDER BY {attribute}+];

                The SELECT clause allows us to specify a comma-separated list
                of attribute names corresponding to the columns that are to be
                retrieved. We can use an asterisk character, *, to retrieve all
                the columns

                The FROM clause is where we specify the name of the table from
                which to retrieve rows.

                The WHERE clause is used to constrain which rows to retrieve.
                We do this by specifying a boolean predicate that compares the
                values of table columns to literal values or to other columns

                The ORDER BY clause gives us a way to order the display of the
                rows in the result of the statement.
